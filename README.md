KASU: (K)ubeadm (A)uto (S)etup on (U)buntu

I want to make a bunch of kubernetes machines but I don't want to create an ISO with everything loaded on it.
So I'll make a script which can be run on a fresh install of JJ Ubuntu, to give me:
1. containerd
2. kubeadm

so that I can either make a control plane or join into one. 👍
Suggestions/help/PRs welcome!
